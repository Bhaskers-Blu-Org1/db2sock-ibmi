#db2sock
Welcome to the db2sock project.  Initial goal of project is to create a  socket based "database" client, and send requests to our new DB2-libdb400.a socket server.

This project originated because of a need to create async DB requests for Node.js on IBM i, but it isn't just for Node.js and can instead be applied to many (all?) PASE langs.
